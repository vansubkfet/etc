# About this folder
This folder contains gnome/gtk scripts to help SWT developers compile/analyze native code. 

The scripts in this folder are not used as part of the build process on a build server,
but only during development work.  

For example install_sysdeps.sh (on linux), is aimed at installing packages that are 
required to be able to build swt native glue code.

For more details, see the description inside each script.
